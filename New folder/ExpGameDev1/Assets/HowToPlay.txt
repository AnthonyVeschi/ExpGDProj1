You are a janitor in a government building.
Every day, you recieve instructions on your phone instructing you to kill one of three lawmakers.
Whoever you kill, their law will not go into effect.
You can only prevent one law per day.
Some laws make it harder for you to find your targets by limiting the information your contact can access.
Some laws make it trickier to navigate the building without getting spotted by guards.
Some laws are just plain strange.
You only have a set time to choose a target and make it to the next day.
Good luck!

Collide with the red box to go to the next level
You lose if you do not make it to the box in 2 minutes
You do not need to kill anyone to not lose, but you'll want to in order to prevent laws from taking effect
